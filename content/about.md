This is my blog created with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package. The Hugo theme is [Zen](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-zen/), created by [Fredrik Jonsson](https://xdeb.net/).

# About Me

I'm Antti Rask, currently living in Helsinki, Finland. I've always been curious about how everything works, but I started learning about data and data science in earnest late in 2019.

I started this blog to document my data journey and if that also helps/inspires others on theirs, that's a win-win situation.

My other passion is music. I write and perform it solo under the name of [Eriparimies](https://open.spotify.com/album/4kAz9nMW7x79sty5dvDaUM?si=wgZEWeIgT2CX-cItiYrzjQ) and I also sing and play the ukulele in a Finnish folk trio [Antti & Isotalo](https://open.spotify.com/album/22w4ujFyiuEs9M2RePkqTV?si=AQQF9Ku6QhysOGLAqXlAhA).
